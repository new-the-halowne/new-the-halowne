<p>I�ve just unlocked michael from the store and want to run the jumpscare myers build. Does anyone have any suggested builds for michael myers? You can swap ruin for pop, but i personally prefer ruin. Michael myers is a fictional character from the halloween series of slasher films.he first appears in john carpenter’s halloween (1978) as a young boy who murders his sister, judith myers, and then, fifteen years later. Please let me know if it works.</p>
