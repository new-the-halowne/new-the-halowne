<p>Once upon a time it denoted a phenomenon even rarer than an extra full moon, one that has occurred perhaps only once or twice in recorded history: This rare calendar event only occurs every few years, giving rise to the term “once in a blue moon“. This type of blue moon occurs when there are four full moons in an astrological season. The face of moon literally appearing to turn blue in color. A hunter’s blue moon on halloween night.</p>

<p>Blue moon is the name given to the second full moon of a month. In this case, there are four full moons between the spring equinox and the summer solstice. The blue moon will likely look no different than any other full moon. Some groups refer to this as the grandmother aspect of the goddess. Now it’s become a holiday, but earlier in the ancient period, it was a time of ritual.</p>

<p>And hopefully, the halloween blue moon of 2020 brings only treats — and no. The phrase “once in a blue moon” has been around for more than 400.

<p>The new moon represents the beginning of our 29 day lunar month. Historically, “blue moon” was understood in a more literal way. ראש השנה לאילנות ‎), literally means new year of the trees. ( read that post, click here ) the combination of the blue and super blood moon on this holiday brought a depth of meaning to what god is doing. But that’s not the only thing that makes this october special. I believe fear has been largely embedded into the holiday simply because with thinner veils and heightened intuition comes fear of the unknown.</p>
