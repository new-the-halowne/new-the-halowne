<p>The twelve days of halloween (sung to “the twelve days of christmas”) at the first house on halloween my neighbor gave to me… a large piece of chocolate taffy The number of halloween songs. So i did a little research on christmas traditions and it turns out ghost stories were as much a part of christmas as they were halloween up until about the turn of the 20th century. So “deck the halls” becomes “deck the patch”, “silver bells” becomes “pumpkin bells”, “the 12 days of christmas” becomes “the 12 days of halloween” and so on. Listen to our best christmas music playlist too.</p>
