<p>The only downside to this is that you will also be up all night. It is the title that led us here that is misleading. These social distancing games can all be played from a distance of 2m away which will mean that you can keep everyone safe, follow lockdown rules and have fun at the same time. But you could have kids set up at the end of their driveways and have adults or older teens drive around and throw candy like it’s a parade! However, this does not mean that it has to be any less fun!</p>

<p>The same idea as a virtual movie night applies here, except that the kids will be up all night having fun. And play party plan has a fun scavenger hunt with clues for you to try. Halloween falls on a saturday this year, so families don’t have to worry about celebrations keeping kids up on a school night. Of course, if halloween falls on a weeknight, you’ll have to wait for your halloween celebration until the weekend, but it will be worth it. Ways to celebrate halloween while social distancing.</p>
