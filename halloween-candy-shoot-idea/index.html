<p>The chute is an awesome idea, especially for those big money houses. A dad in ohio devised a pretty brilliant way to hand out halloween candy while keeping kids 6 feet from him and his house. He also shared his revolutionary idea on a few halloween. Find a costume that allows one. The idea of the candy slide keeps the 6 feet social distance, but allows the kids to still collect candy from you!</p>

<p>Take a bunch of saran wrap, lay it out in long sheets, and then place your candy on it as you start to roll it up into a ball forming a multilayered candy orb contained inside one of those most annoying materials ever manufactured by the human hand. (cnn) an ohio man has an idea to keep the coronavirus from knocking on his door this halloween. She made a candy shoot. A few years ago, someone told courtney deutsch the family who previously owned her family’s oakwood house used to dispense candy on halloween via a chute from the second story. Basically you shoot the candy like you’re steph curry, and the kids try to catch it in their pails and pillow cases.</p>
