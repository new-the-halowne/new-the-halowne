<p>An everyday high school principal has a secret life as a serial killer; There are plenty of films in the franchise to fill your october, but highlights include “scary movie 2,” which earned 71 million, and “scary movie 3,” which earned $110 million. While still having a few scary moments, i would say this is a lighter version of a scary movie. The original location of the house was 707 meridian avenue, right down the block from the current address, during the filming of halloween.due to the extremely low budget allocated to the film, director john carpenter actually shot the exteriors and interiors at the house, making it one helluva a movie location gem for fans. The burbs is a fun movie to watch around halloween time.</p>
